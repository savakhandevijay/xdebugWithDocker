# Xdebug introduction
*Xdebug is an extension for PHP, and provides a range of features to improve the PHP development experience*

# Xdebug setup
    - Alway check your php version is compatible with Xdebug version
    - Xdebug is not provided with PHP libs, we need to install it via pecl,
    - for xdebug compatibility, check [link] (https://pecl.php.net/package/xdebug), click on [changelog], right side column
    - command to install `pecl install xdebug-3.x`,
    - Alway prefer to specifies exact version you are looking for, ex. xdebug-3.2.1, which is stable version & compatible with php 8.2.x version, as there is always compatibility issue.
